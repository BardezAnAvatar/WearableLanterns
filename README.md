**[Wearable Lanterns](http://skyrimsurvival.com/home/wearable-lanterns/)** is the definitive worn lantern mod for **The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim**.

Adds a craftable, wearable travel lantern that can be hooked onto your belt, or carried in your hand. Catch a torchbug in an empty torchbug lantern and let it light the way in dark dungeons while you keep your hands free during combat and adventuring. If Dragonborn is installed, you can craft a paper lantern as well.

If **[Campfire](http://skyrimsurvival.com/home/campfire/)** is installed, you can craft travel and paper lanterns from Survival Skills: Create Item, and use lantern oil as tinder for your campfire.

The lantern’s placement on the belt was inspired by Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess. It also heralds the visual style of Dragon’s Dogma. The way you use and toggle your lantern (held or worn) can be changed using the SkyUI Mod Configuration Menu. Wearable Lanterns supports both keyboard and gamepad control.
